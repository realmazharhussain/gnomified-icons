# gnomish-icons

Alternate versions of icons that look ugly on GNOME.

**Note**: I am not an artist. Every icon in this collection is made/designed by someone else.
I just collect them into a unified icon theme. See [Credits.md](Credits.md).

## Installation
First, make sure `wget`, `tar`, and `gz` are installed on your systtem. Then run the following
commands on the terminal

```sh
wget https://github.com/realmazharhussain/gnomish-icons/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz -O gnomish-icons-main.tar.gz
tar --extract --file gnomish-icons-main.tar.gz
cd gnomish-icons-main
sh ./install.sh
```

### Uninstall
To uninstall, just remove the `~/.local/share/icons/Gnomish` directory.
